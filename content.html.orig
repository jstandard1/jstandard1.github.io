      <p>If you’ll be soon heading on a business trip to Tokyo or elsewhere in Japan, this quick guide will walk you through what you should do BEFORE you leave and what to expect when you meet and interact with your Japanese hosts.</p>

      <h3>Bring a Gift</h3>
      <p>Gift giving is embedded in Japanese culture. Gifts do not need to be expensive, but will be appreciated as an indication you spent time to consider your hosts.</p>
      Here are a few tried and true examples:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Artisan chocolates.</b> Avoid very sweet ones and also avoid mint chocolates which are not popular in Japan.</li>
        <li><b>Snacks from Trader Joes.</b> Goods from here have a great mix of interesting packaging, a distinctive brand, and are generally tasty.</li>
        <li><b>Useful company swag such as notebooks or mugs.</b></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bowing Vs. Shaking Hands</h3>
      <p>Japanese do not typically shake hands with each other, but rather exchange bows. However, they generally know Western business people do and it is acceptable to shake hands</p>

      It is polite to bow to your hosts while keeping in mind these rules:
      <ul>
        <li>DO NOT put your hands in prayer position. NO ONE DOES THIS!</li>
        <li>Don't bow too deeply. Generally an incline of the head is enough.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Business Cards</h3>
      <p>Meetings generally don’t begin until everyone in the room has finished exchanging their business cards. Typically the highest rank person exchanges cards first. Treat business cards as treasures, as if they are an extension of your hosts.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Don't put them in your clothes pockets. Place them on the desk during the meeting and then slip them into your briefcase or, ideally, your business card holder.</li>
        <li>Do not write on them, it's rude!</li>
      </ul>

      There is a special ritual typically followed during the physical exchange of the cards, where you present them with 2 hands and transition to accepting your counterpart’s card with 2 hands.

      <h3>Meetings</h3>
      <p>Be on-time! Japanese are very punctual, often arriving 5-10 mins early to a meeting. Being late shows a lack of preparation and lack of respect for others’ time.</p>

      <i>Pro Tip:</i> To help remember names, arrange your business cards to match the seating arrangements.

      <h3>Dress</h3>
      <p>Japan is generally conservative when it comes to business attire, particularly Tokyo. Men are expected to suit up!, including jackets and ties while avoiding jeans or casual clothes. Women should avoid above-the-knee skirts and wear stockings, even in humid summer weather.</p>

      <h3>Conversation</h3>
      <p>Make sure to speak extra slowly and clearly if you’re unsure about the English ability of those in the room. They will likely not ask you to slow down out of politeness or shyness to admit they do not understand. Japan has a non-confrontational culture and a communication style filled with non-verbal cues and subtleties. There are a few other common verbal cues to be aware of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>"Yes" does not always mean "Yes".</b> In many cases it may simply mean acknowledgement of your statement. You may need to ask specific questions to clarify what the "Yes" actually means.</li>
        <li><b>"It's difficult" likely means "No" or "We cannot/will not".</b> It is <i>not</i> a statement about the difficulty of a task.</li>
        <li><b>Be comfortable with silence.</b> Silence is not nearly as terrifying to conversation in Japan as it is in Western countries where people may speak just to avoid an awkward lull in the conversation.</li>
      </ul>
