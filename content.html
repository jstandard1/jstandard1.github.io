      <h2>Business 101</h2>

      <p>If you’ll be soon heading on a business trip to Tokyo or elsewhere in Japan, this quick guide will walk you through what you should do BEFORE you leave and what to expect when you meet and interact with your Japanese hosts.</p>

      <h3>Bring a Gift</h3>
      <p>Gift giving is embedded in Japanese culture. Gifts do not need to be expensive, but will be appreciated as an indication you spent time to consider your hosts.</p>
      Here are a few tried and true examples:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Artisan chocolates.</b> Avoid very sweet ones and also avoid mint chocolates which are not popular in Japan.</li>
        <li><b>Snacks from Trader Joes.</b> Goods from here have a great mix of interesting packaging, a distinctive brand, and are generally tasty.</li>
        <li><b>Useful company swag such as notebooks or mugs.</b></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bowing Vs. Shaking Hands</h3>
      <p>Japanese do not typically shake hands with each other, but rather exchange bows. However, they generally know Western business people do and it is acceptable to shake hands</p>

      It is polite to bow to your hosts while keeping in mind these rules:
      <ul>
        <li>DO NOT put your hands in prayer position. NO ONE DOES THIS!</li>
        <li>Don't bow too deeply. Generally an incline of the head is enough.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Business Cards</h3>
      <p>Meetings generally don’t begin until everyone in the room has finished exchanging their business cards. Typically the highest rank person exchanges cards first. Treat business cards as treasures, as if they are an extension of your hosts.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Don't put them in your clothes pockets. Place them on the desk during the meeting and then slip them into your briefcase or, ideally, your business card holder.</li>
        <li>Do not write on them, it's rude!</li>
      </ul>

      There is a special ritual typically followed during the physical exchange of the cards, where you present them with 2 hands and transition to accepting your counterpart’s card with 2 hands.

      See this video for more information: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY53ZbOU0G0">Youtube Link</a>

      <h3>Meetings</h3>
      <p>Be on-time! Japanese are very punctual, often arriving 5-10 mins early to a meeting. Being late shows a lack of preparation and lack of respect for others’ time.</p>

      <i>Pro Tip:</i> To help remember names, arrange your business cards to match the seating arrangements.

      <h3>Dress</h3>
      <p>Japan is generally conservative when it comes to business attire, particularly Tokyo. Men are expected to suit up!, including jackets and ties while avoiding jeans or casual clothes. Women should avoid above-the-knee skirts and wear stockings, even in humid summer weather.</p>

      <h3>Conversation</h3>
      <p>Make sure to speak extra slowly and clearly if you’re unsure about the English ability of those in the room. They will likely not ask you to slow down out of politeness or shyness to admit they do not understand. Japan has a non-confrontational culture and a communication style filled with non-verbal cues and subtleties. There are a few other common verbal cues to be aware of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>"Yes" does not always mean "Yes".</b> In many cases it may simply mean acknowledgement of your statement. You may need to ask specific questions to clarify what the "Yes" actually means.</li>
        <li><b>"It's difficult" likely means "No" or "We cannot/will not".</b> It is <i>not</i> a statement about the difficulty of a task.</li>
        <li><b>Be comfortable with silence.</b> Silence is not nearly as terrifying to conversation in Japan as it is in Western countries where people may speak just to avoid an awkward lull in the conversation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Transportation</h2>
      <p>Japan’s train system is equal parts magical and intimidating for first-timers. However, you’ll need to master the basics as other forms of transport are expensive (taxis) or even trickier to use (buses).</p>

      <h3>Trains</h3>
      <p>In Tokyo the most common train system you’ll take is called the “JR”, short for Japan Rail. There are 6 major JR lines in Tokyo.</p>

      <h4>Tickets</h4>
      <p>There are 2 main types of tickets for trains</p>

      <u>Single-use Tickets</u>
      <img src="/img/ticket_small.png"><img src="/img/ticket_shinkansen.png">
      <ul>
        <li>Generally used for short distances.</li>
        <li>Purchased for a specific amount of money (ex. ¥280). The more you spend, the farther you can go.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>How to use</p>
      <ol>
        <li>When entering the station, insert into the opening at the front of the ticket gate.</li>
        <li>The ticket will come back out. MAKE SURE TO TAKE IT!</li>
        <li>When exiting the station, insert the ticket as before. If you chose the right amount of money, the ticket will not come back out.</li>
      </ol>

      <u>Suica (rechargeable card)</u>
      <img src="/img/trains_suica.png">
      <p>A credit card-sized plastic card which you add money to.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You add money to the card and just scan it as you enter/exit trains.</li>
        <li>If you run low on money, just add more from a ticket machine.</li>
        <li>1000x more convenient than buying single tickets everywhere.</li>
        <li>Can also be used to make purchases at most convenience stores and vending machines.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>How to use</p>
      <ol>
        <li>When entering the station, just scan it at the front of the ticket gate.</li>
        <li>When exiting, do the same.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Where to buy</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The JR office in Narita Airport (recommended as you receive a discount)</li>
        <li>Ticket kiosks at most major train stations. (note: takes some setup time as you need to enter your name)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>What if I have a problem or aren't sure how to go somewhere?</h4>
      <p>Ask a station attendant. They're inside a small room near the ticket gates.</p>
